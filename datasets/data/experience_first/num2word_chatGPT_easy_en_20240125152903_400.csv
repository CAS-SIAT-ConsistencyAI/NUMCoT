Moving to the left, we have 890,000,000. We pronounce this as ""eight hundred and ninety million"". Finally, we combine the two parts to get the complete pronunciation. So, the number 890000001 is pronounced as ""eight hundred and ninety million one"".",1,"[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an excellent English artificial intelligence assistant in mathematics, the following is a question about how to convert integers into English pronunciation.

Three-digit numbers can be pronounced by reading the hundreds digit, followed by ""hundred,"" and then the two-digit number that follows.950 can be pronounced as ""nine hundred fifty.""3. Move on to the next group, 000 (which represents thousands).Since this group is all zeros, it does not need to be pronounced.4.
