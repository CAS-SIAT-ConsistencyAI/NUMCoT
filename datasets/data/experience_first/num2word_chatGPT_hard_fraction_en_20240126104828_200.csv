Now, let's put these digits together, considering their position:   - ""Eight hundred thirteen thousand"" (813000),   - ""eight hundred"" (800),   - ""forty-eight"" (48).6. So the numerator can be pronounced as ""Eight hundred thirteen thousand eight hundred forty-eight"".7. Similarly, let's break down the denominator 701202 into individual digits: 7, 0, 1, 2, 0 ,2.8.
