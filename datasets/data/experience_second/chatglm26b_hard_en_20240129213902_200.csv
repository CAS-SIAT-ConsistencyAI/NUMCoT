Find the individual weight of each group: 9 kg - 5 kg = 4 kg4. Find the individual weight of the first group in grams: 4 kg * 1000 g / kg = 4000 g5. Find the total weight of the first group in grams: 4000 g + 442 g = 4442 g6. Find the total weight of the second group in grams: 17 kg * 1000 g / kg = 17000 g7. Find the total weight of the second group in grams: 17000 g + 442 g = 17442 g8. Find the difference between the total weight of the first group and the second group: 17442 g - 4442 g = 13000 g9.
