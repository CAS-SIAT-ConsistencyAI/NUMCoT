First, we need to convert the mixed units (2 minutes 691 seconds) into a single unit. We can do this by adding the minutes and seconds together, and then converting the total into minutes.\n\n2. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we can convert 691 seconds into minutes by dividing it by 60:\n\n691 seconds ÷ 60 = 11.52 minutes\n\n3. Now, we add the 2 minutes and 11.52 minutes to get the total minutes:\n\n2 minutes + 11.52 minutes = 13.52 minutes\n\n4. Since we have already converted all the seconds to minutes, the final answer is in minutes and seconds:\n\n13.52 minutes\n\n5. However, the question mark indicates that we need to provide the answer in minutes and seconds. So, we need to find out how many seconds are left after converting the 691 seconds.\n\n6. We can do this by subtracting the 60 seconds (1 minute) from the 691 seconds:\n\n691 seconds - 60 seconds = 631 seconds\n\n7. Now, we have the total number of seconds (631 seconds) and the total number of minutes (13.52 minutes). To express the answer in a mixed format, we can convert the remaining 631 seconds into minutes and add it to the existing 13.52 minutes.\n\n8. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we can convert 631 seconds into minutes by dividing it by 60:\n\n631 seconds ÷ 60 = 10.52 minutes\n\n9. Now, we add the 13.52 minutes and 10.52 minutes to get the final answer:\n\n13.52 minutes + 10.52 minutes = 24.04 minutes\n\n10.

Next, convert 16 meters to decimeters:\n16 meters = 16 * 10 = 160 decimeters\n\n3. Now, subtract 16 meters (160 decimeters) from 5 meters (50 decimeters):\n50 decimeters - 160 decimeters = -110 decimeters\n\n4. The result is negative, which means it's actually a decrease in distance. So, we can rephrase the question as:\n\5 meters 918 decimeters minus 16 meters is equal to how many meters and how many decimeters?\\n\n5. To find the answer, we need to convert the negative decimeters to meters and add it to the remaining meters. Since 1 meter is equal to 10 decimeters, we can convert the negative decimeters to meters as follows:\n-110 decimeters = -11 meters\n\n6. Now, add the remaining meters and the converted meters:\n5 meters + (-11 meters) = -6 meters\n\n7.
