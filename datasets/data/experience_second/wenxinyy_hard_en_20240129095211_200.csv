We know that 1 second = 1000 milliseconds, so 4 seconds = 4 * 1000 = 4000 milliseconds.Now we add the 685 milliseconds from the first number and the 91 milliseconds from the second number. The total is 685 + 91 = 776 milliseconds.Finally, we need to convert the resulting milliseconds back into seconds. We know that 1 second = 1000 milliseconds, so we divide the total milliseconds by 1000 to get the number of seconds.The answer is:(4 * 1000) + 91 = 4091 millisecondsTo convert this back into seconds, we divide by 1000 again:4091 milliseconds / 1000 = 4.091 secondsTherefore, the answer is:4.685 seconds and 776 milliseconds = ?? = (4 + (685/1000)) + (91/1000) = 4.697 seconds and 776 milliseconds.",1,"[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The following is a question about unit conversion.

Additionally, 97 tons = 97 * 1000 = 97000 kilograms. Adding these two values together, we get 9855 + 97000 = 106855 kilograms. To convert this to tons, we need to know that 1 ton = 1/1000 tons, so we multiply the result by this ratio: 106855 kg * (1/1000) = 106.855 tons.
