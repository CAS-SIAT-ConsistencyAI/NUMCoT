Step 2: Jessica cuts some red orchids from her flower garden. Let's assume she cuts x number of red orchids. Step 3: After Jessica cuts the red orchids, there are now 18 red orchids in the vase. Step 4: To find out how many red orchids Jessica cut, we can set up an equation: 2 (initial number of red orchids) - x (number of red orchids Jessica cut) = 18 (final number of red orchids in the vase)Step 5: Simplifying the equation, we have: 2 - x = 18 Step 6: By solving for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: -x = 16 Step 7: To get x alone, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1: x = -16 However, in the given scenario, it does not make sense to have a negative number of orchids, so the answer is: Jessica did not cut any red orchids, as the equation does not have a positive solution.",1,"[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The following are questions containing unit and numerical calculations.
