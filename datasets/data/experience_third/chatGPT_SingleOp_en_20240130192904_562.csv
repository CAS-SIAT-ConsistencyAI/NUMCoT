How many whole boxes did he eat and how many Lemon Heads does he have left?\n  Answer：Let's think step by step, ""}]","Louis ate 54 Lemon Heads, and each package comes with 6 Lemon Heads. To find out how many whole boxes he ate, we can divide the number of Lemon Heads he ate by the number of Lemon Heads in each package: 54 / 6 = 9 whole boxes.To find out how many Lemon Heads he has left, we need to determine the remainder of the division. Since he ate 9 whole boxes, he consumed 9 * 6 = 54 Lemon Heads. Therefore, he has 0 Lemon Heads left.So, Louis ate 9 whole boxes of Lemon Heads and has 0 Lemon Heads left.",1
