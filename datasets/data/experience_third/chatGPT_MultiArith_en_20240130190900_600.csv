Since there are 2 problems on each worksheet, the total number of problems on 14 worksheets would be 14 x 2 = 28 problems.Next, we need to find out how many problems the teacher has graded so far. Since the teacher has already graded 7 worksheets, the number of problems she has graded is 7 x 2 = 14 problems.To find out how many more problems the teacher has to grade, we subtract the number of problems graded from the total number of problems.
