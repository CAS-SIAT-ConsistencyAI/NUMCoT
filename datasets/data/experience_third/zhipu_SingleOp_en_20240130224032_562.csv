How many miles did they have left to drive?\n  Answer：'}]","To find the answer to this question, we need to consider the fuel efficiency of the car and the amount of gas Mrs. Hilt and her sister stopped to fill up.\n\n1. First, we need to know the fuel efficiency of the car. Let's assume they drive an average of 25 miles per gallon (mpg).\n2. They drove 32 miles and stopped for gas. To calculate how many gallons they needed to fill up, we can divide the distance traveled by the fuel efficiency:\n\n32 miles / 25 mpg = 1.28 gallons\n\nHowever, they actually put 28 gallons in the car. So, they filled up an extra 28 gallons - 1.28 gallons = 26.72 gallons.\n\n1. Now, we need to calculate how many miles these additional gallons will take them. We can do this by dividing the additional gallons by the fuel efficiency:\n\n26.72 gallons / 25 mpg = 1.0688 miles\n\n1. Finally, we add the 32 miles they already drove to find the total distance they had left to drive:\n\n32 miles + 1.0688 miles = 33.0688 miles\n\nSo, they had 33.0688 miles left to drive.

We need to find out how many cases of 8 boxes and extra boxes she needs to deliver.\n\nFirst, we'll calculate the number of cases Jenny needs. We do this by dividing the total number of boxes (24) by the number of boxes per case (8):\n\n24 boxes / 8 boxes per case = 3 cases\n\nNow, we'll calculate the number of extra boxes Jenny needs to deliver. We do this by subtracting the number of boxes in the cases (24 boxes - 3 cases * 8 boxes per case) :\n\n24 boxes - (3 cases * 8 boxes per case) = 24 boxes - 24 boxes = 0 boxes\n\nSo, Jenny needs to deliver 3 cases of 8 boxes, and she doesn't need any extra boxes.\n\nAnswer: Jenny needs to deliver 3 cases of 8 boxes.
